## Managing Pricing

### Updating Prices

1. **Edit the centralized pricing file:**
   ```bash
   /website/src/content/pricing.json
   ```

2. **Update relevant sections:**
   - Labor rates: `pricing.laborRates.residential` or `pricing.laborRates.business`
   - Trip charges: `pricing.tripCharges.localHomeVisit`, `extendedHomeVisit`, or `businessVisit`
   - Retainer plans: `pricing.retainerPlans.managedCareBasic`, `managedCarePlus`, or `managedCarePremium`
   - Service packages: `pricing.servicePackages.computerRepair`, `businessIT`, or `communityEducation`

3. **Run validation tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test -- src/test/pricing-validation.test.ts
   ```

4. **Update services.json if needed:**
   Ensure pricing in `/website/src/content/services.json` matches the centralized pricing structure.

### Accessing Pricing in Code

Use the helper functions from `/website/src/lib/pricing.ts`:

```typescript
import { 
  getLaborRate, 
  getTripCharge, 
  getRetainerPlan,
  getServicePackage,
  getPricingPolicy,
  formatPrice,
  formatPriceRange 
} from '@/lib/pricing';

// Get residential hourly rate
const residentialRate = getLaborRate('residential');
console.log(residentialRate.hourlyRate); // 60

// Get trip charge for local home visit
const localVisit = getTripCharge('localHomeVisit');
console.log(localVisit.fee); // 0 (free)

// Get basic retainer plan
const basicPlan = getRetainerPlan('managedCareBasic');
console.log(basicPlan.monthlyFee); // 75

// Format prices for display
console.log(formatPrice(500)); // "$500"
console.log(formatPriceRange(100, 300)); // "$100-$300"
```

### TypeScript Types

All pricing types are defined in `/website/src/lib/types/content.ts`:
- `PricingStructure` - Main pricing structure
- `LaborRate` - Hourly rate structure
- `TripCharge` - Trip charge structure
- `RetainerPlan` - Managed care plan structure
- `ServicePackageItem` - Individual service pricing
- `PricingPolicy` - Pricing philosophy and terms

## Consistency Checklist

When updating pricing, ensure:

- [ ] Pricing in `pricing.json` is updated
- [ ] Related pricing in `services.json` matches
- [ ] Features in `services.json` mention correct prices
- [ ] All validation tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated if principles change
- [ ] Website content reflects new pricing (if displaying prices)

## Testing

Run the comprehensive pricing validation test suite:

```bash
# Run pricing tests only
npm run test -- src/test/pricing-validation.test.ts

# Run all tests
npm run test
```

The test suite validates:
- All required pricing sections exist
- Price consistency between tiers
- Format validation
- No placeholder content
- Consistency with services.json
- Transparency requirements

## Three-Step Workflow
